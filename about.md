Jonathan Mendez is a student attending Allegheny College. He is a double major in
both music and computer science. He is currently freshman at the college. Jonathan
was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1998. His family lives in Old Bridge, New Jersey.

Jonathan attended Old Bridge High School where he graduated in 2016. While there
he participated in numerous music ensembles such as the symphonic band, wind ensemble,
and marching band. His primary instrument is the euphonium, however he also knows
how to play the cymbals, bassdrum, and trombone. Jonathan has auditioned and performed
with the Central Jersey Music Educators Association (CJMEA) and is currently contracted
to march with the Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps.

His interest in computer science comes from his interest in video games. Jonathan
has been playing videogames since he owned his own Playstation One and Gameboy. He
learned to enjoy shooters like Call of Duty and Counter Strike. He has participated
in numerous programs that involved creating and designing levels for games, but never
coding an actually game itself. Now that he is out of highschool, Jonathan has been
able to take courses to get closer to this goal. He is not sure what he wants to
do with both these majors, however Jonathan has ideas and interests that he is pursuing.
